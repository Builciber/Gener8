# Gener8: Generative NFT Art Engine

Gener8 is a desktop application with a special focus on ease-of-use and speed that helps artists automate the generation of NFT collection arts. The current version of the MVP is equipped enough to help the artist with simple collection requirements generate their NFT collection art at warp speed â€” compared to competitors. Artists with special requirements might need to look elsewhere for **now**.

### NOTE
> Gener8's final form is a packaged desktop application. This repository exists to facilitate open-source contributions from devs the world over, but the code therein is functional enough to allow anyone with the slightest programming background to run Gener8 as is to satisfy their needs.
